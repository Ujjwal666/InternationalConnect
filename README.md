Inspiration
We are a group of international students from Nepal. While coming to the capital of the United States to go to college at Howard, we had to face a lot of challenges just to survive. Finding classrooms, finding housing resources, finding on-campus jobs and everything else. We wished that something like International+ existed that solely helped international students. Keeping ourselves and all other international students that are yet to come to Howard to find their dreams, we came up with International+

What it does
It acts as a social media for international students to come together and share their known academic and social resources. They make connections and friends within the application, they compose posts, search for different resources within our application.

How we built it
At first we created user story boards and prototypes using free-sketching and figma. Then, we used Android Studio and coded on Java to make this product.

Challenges we ran into
We wanted to implement commenting and messaging feature in our MVP but we ran into errors while laying out our layouts and properly rendering comments from the backend. We spent a lot of time on the chat feature as well but it did not work out correctly. But we made the pictures and descriptions render correctly at the end and it all worked out.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we could create a full fledged CRUD application with low-code backend and scalable design. We are proud of being able to implement backend with api explorer that will be very scalable if we are to go company in the future.
